# Monster-Fighter
# Summer project with the Ventura College Computer Science Club, four fighter types compete in a simple turn based battle.

# This is a creature personal project for the Computer Science Club by Allison LeBus
# Prompt:  Make four creature types, try to have at least one example of inheritance; have at least three different
# attributes for each creature, have the creatures be able to fight. Simple project, use your
# creativity to make it as simple or complex as you like! Finish by 7/17/2020, we can go over everyone's code
# next meeting.

# There will be two main classes, magic user and weapon user. This will determine damage type and health.
